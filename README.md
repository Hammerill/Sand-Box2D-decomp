# Sand-Box2D Decomp
A decompilation of the old version of [Sand-Box2D](https://github.com/Hammerill/Sand-Box2D).

# Why?
I want to start to really decompiling something, so I'll start with my own code (a binary of it to be exact) with all debug info to make it very easy for the beginning. When my decompilation skills will get better, I'll try to decompile a real raw binary after that.
